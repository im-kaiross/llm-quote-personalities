# LLM "personalities" - a bored student's first "paper"
>1: i'll use human pronouns because it's hard not to anthropomorphize them and the used pron's are what i felt like calling them, | 2: fuck grammar and formality, i write essays every other week, so i get to do what i want with my own writing


# what do i mean by "personalities" for LLMs? and why did i do this?
to sum it up, i noticed when interacting with all sorts of LLMs they all acted a little differently and had their own "personalities", now i assume this is a consequence of their architecture, training data, system prompt, user prompt, and jsut the temperature value but it was still consistent per model so i looked into it a bit and here we are


# let's get started
>note: i dont know formatting for shit so i'll jsut use basic ascii stuff but i'll try to make it look ok

we're gonna start with the smaller models first
